							<h2>What is Political Polarization?</h2>
							<p>Political polarization is when people become divided along opposing political views, and only communicate with those that share their same viewpoint or perspective. Other phrases for it are echo chambers, filter bubbles, and homophily clusters. It is especially prominent on Facebook and Twitter. This fragmentation of ideas on the Internet could be a result of personalization technologies and one's own confirmation bias. </p>

							<h2>Role Algorithms play in selective information</h2>
							<p>Today, social media is highly personalized and catered to one's interests. This sounds good, but creates an echo chamber because our feeds only show what we want to see. This is called Network Homophily, where nodes of a network cluster near other similar nodes algorithmically, where the nodes consist of interests you share with your friend network. Specifically, Facebook's News Feed depends on an algorithm called EdgeRank.  </p>

							<h2>Why this is an issue (in relation to the 2016 election)</h2>
							<p> In accordance with network homophily on Facebook, users were unaware how much of their peers really agreed or disagreed with them. Since algorithms on social media suppress opposing views and are divisive, it is hard for us to gauge who really agreed or disagreed with us. Furthermore, this leads to very little perspective politically. When all your peers reaffirm your beliefs, it makes you believe you are right.</p>

							<h2>Political Participation </h2>
							<p> The US trails behind other major countries in voter turnout due to voter apathy, but social media has the ability to mobilize potential voters. One study found that online outreach was more likely to get younger voters to be involved in the election.  </p>

							<h2>Potential Solutions</h2>

								<section>
									<span class="icon style2 major fa-diamond"></span>
									<h3>Hold Tech Companies Accountable</h3>
									<p>Tech moguls like Mark Zuckerberg have denied Facebook's culpability in the creation of echo chambers, but the results are clear. Tech companies are partly responsible as they created the personalizatoin that comes with social media under the guise of "better" connection, when in reality, it stifles our understanding of the world. </p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon style2 major fa-save"></span>
									<h3>Improve Algorithms</h3>
									<p>Just like how algorithms have created the dilemma we are in, they can just as easily reverse it. With apps that allow us to meet people of opposing viewpoints, we can just as easily have a good social media experience while not being close minded. </p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon style2 major fa-bar-chart"></span>
									<h3>Ethics</h3>
									<p>For software developers, learn about the ethics behind what you are doing. Realize the consequences behind the products you create and how they may or may not push us towards a society that is like "Black Mirror."</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon style2 major fa-wifi"></span>
									<h3>Digital Literacy</h3>
									<p> Don't just block those that disagree with you. Learn to understand where they are coming from, but at the same time, don't shy away from tough conversations or discourse. </p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon style2 major fa-cog"></span>
									 <h3>Discourse</h3>
									<p>Engage in healthy dialogue with people that are your ideological opposite. Seeing opposing sides of the political spectrum can help dispel exaggerations and how they are portrayed by the media.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon style2 major fa-paper-plane"></span>
									<h3>Adjusting your News Feed</h3>
									<p>Adjust the settings under News Feed Preferences, and set the posts you want to see when you log in. Choose sources that are well-rounded and wide-ranging to get a mix of different opinions, as well as feeds of pages opposing your interests (e.g. conservative versus liberal). Read articles before liking or sharing. Verify suspicious items on Snopes or other myth-debunking sites, or even Google them and verify with prestigious news sites.
And perhaps most importantly: Go to the source. Facebook might be convenient, but the best way to break out of the social media echo chamber is to go straight to trusted news sources. Make a point to visit these websites every morning or evening – before you spend time on Facebook.</p>
